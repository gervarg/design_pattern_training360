DESIGN PATTERNS
===========================

* Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; _guidelines_(!) on how to tackle certain problems.
* Be careful!
    * Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
    * Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so. 
    * Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions to problems, not solutions finding problems; so don't overthink. (!)
    * If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.
